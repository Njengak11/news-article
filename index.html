  <h3>Spain Knocked out!</h3>
  <p>
Iago Aspas went down the middle. It wasn’t a good penalty. Decent height for a goalkeeper, not struck with any real certainty. It was all too much for Spain by then.
Igor Akinfeev, in goal, had committed himself to his right, but left enough in the heart of goal that he might get lucky. He got lucky. Aspas’s shot struck his left boot and disappeared up in the air like a clearance. The roar was deafening. The pitch invasion, by Russian players who had looked dead on their feet moments earlier, as thunderous as an cavalry charge.
Russia were through; Spain were gone. Fernando Hierro’s great gamble, leaving Andres Iniesta out of his first tournament knockout starting line-up in 12 years, had not paid off. Spain were a mish-mash of ideas and concepts. They had Diego Costa upfront but never gave him the service he requires. They played endless passes in midfield, but left the best passer in the country imprisoned on the bench for more than an hour.
